## 🌊 The Philosophy: Why GetChart Exists?

> *"TradingView is a library. GetChart is a sniper rifle."*

Modern trading platforms are broken. Traders are drowning in noise, wasting hours filtering through thousands of useless, repainting indicators created by amateurs. The mobile experience is usually an afterthought, clunky and slow.

**I got tired of the chaos. So I built the solution.**

**GetChart** is a curated, high-performance ecosystem designed for one purpose: **Clarity**.
It aggregates global market data, processes it through complex backend algorithms, and delivers clear signals. No noise. No lag. Just pure alpha.

## 🧠 The Arsenal: Beyond Standard Indicators

This isn't just "price action." The system calculates deep market metrics in real-time.

### 📊 1. Institutional Liquidation Levels
Most traders guess where the stops are. **My backend calculates it.**
* The system analyzes global order book data to visualize where Market Makers are likely to hunt liquidity.
* **Result:** You see the "kill zones" before price gets there.

### ⚖️ 2. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis
* **Long/Short Ratio:** Instantly spot when the crowd is overly bullish (bull trap) or bearish (bear trap).
* **Net Taker Volume:** See the *real* aggressive buying or selling pressure hidden inside the candles.

### 📱 3. True Mobile-First Experience
* Traders aren't always at their desks. I engineered the frontend to be fully responsive.
* **Complex charts, liquidation heatmaps, and alert panels** — all optimized for your phone screen.

### 🚨 4. Intelligent Alerting System
* Forget simple price alerts.
* **Logic:** *"Alert me when Long/Short Ratio spikes > 2.5 AND Price hits Liquidation Level."*
* Delivered instantly via Telegram and WebSocket.

## 🛠 Under the Hood: Built for Speed

I chose this stack not because it's trendy, but because it handles **thousands of websocket messages per second**.
